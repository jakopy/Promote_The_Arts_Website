                <p> Hello I am Jacob Isaacs, </p>
                <p> My history as an artist started at an extremely young age.
                    The time that I could pick up a pen or paintbrush, 
                    was the day I became an artist. </p>
                <p> My favorite class in elementary school was taught by a teacher that
                    also happened to specialize in art therapy. As a tiny sprout I was taught
                    that art could be used to express my emotions and I could use it as a 
                    tool to find and define myself as a person. </p>
                <p> After taking the class my fondest memories were with a friend named Austin Williams. </p>
                <p> Austin and I would draw together on the same piece of paper, and we both
                    found a deep appreciation for aquatic life, so we mainly drew sharks and weird deep sea creatrues. </p>
                <p> My best friend Austin eventually had to move to washington state, because that's where his dad found a job.
                    It was then that my parents signed me up for several art classes outside of school. </p>
                <p> I took art classes at the Visual Arts Center of Richmond. </p>
                <p> The classes that I took were animation, photography, creative writing, sculpting,
                    painting and drawing. </p>
                <p> All through out middle school I continued to learn and experiment with drawing until
                    I found myself old enough to enter High School. </p>
                <p> Once I got into High School my first choice in electives was of course Fine Art.</p>
                <p> When I took the first Fine Art course I found myself loving it so much that I ended up going onto
                    the Highest level of Fine Art that my High School offered, Fine Art III. </p>
                <p> After High School I somehow ended up going to school for Engineering. </p>
                <p> I now have a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics with a concentration in Operations Research. </p>
                <p> Eventhough I went through intense Mathematical Study I never gave up on Art, my one true passion. </p>
                <p> While I was in school I decided to experiment with ways to make my art more than just a hobby, but a way
                    of earning a living. </p>
                <p> I showcased my work in several different Galleries and ended up losing quite a bit of money. </p>
                <p> I then experimented at several different venues with selling different products with my paintings. </p>
                <p> I was more successful selling trinkets than actual pieces, which lead me towards the idea of merchandising my work. </p>
                <p> After several different experiments I believe that I have finally come across a solution. </p>
