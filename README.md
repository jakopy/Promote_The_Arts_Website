About
=====
All of the art work on this website that exists on this website has been created by myself with the exception of shoop's user page. All photography, paintings mixed media etc. are pieces that I have produced over the years. The promote the arts logo was also hand drawn then edited with photoshop. If you wish to view all of the pieces that I have created you can either navigate through the images folder or can view my work by going through the website via the site pages folder then clicking on homepage.html
